# Cattle Monitoring System

Developed a Cattle Monitoring System using MERN stack to detect lumpy disease in cows.
Integrated real-time data collection on cow activity (steps count, temperature, milk production) via an API to assess health.
Built a machine learning model for image classification to analyze cow images and predict lumpy disease.
Implemented a continuous monitoring system, allowing farmers to upload images for daily health analysis over a period of time.
Designed backend API to process data, perform AI-driven predictions, and send health alerts to the frontend.
